# How to contribute

## Forking

- to contribute please create a fork within your own namespace
- after making your changes, create a pull request that will merge your state into upstream

## Commits & pull requests

- Commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification.
- During development (within a feature branch) commits may have any naming whatsoever.
- After a PR has been approved, it will be squashed and merged into `main`.
- The final commit message must adhere to the specification mentioned above.
- A GitHub Workflow will make sure that the PR title and description matches this specification.

## Labels

- there are some different labels for issues and pull requests (e.g. bug and fix)
- the labels on pull requests resemble the conventional commits specification
- the "highest" label should then be used for the final commit message (e.g. feat above fix, or fix above refactor)
    - TODO: create exhaustive list of label order
