## What is SurrealDB?

SurrealDB is a cutting-edge database system that offers a SQL-style query language with real-time queries  
and efficient related data retrieval. It supports both schema-full and schema-less data handling.
With its full graph database functionality, SurrealDB enables advanced querying and analysis by allowing
records (or vertices) to be connected with edges, each with its own properties and metadata.
This facilitates multi-table, multi-depth document retrieval without complex JOINs, all within the database.
