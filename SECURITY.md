# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to maintaining the security of this repository and its associated software.
As part of this commitment, we provide security updates for the most recent release.
Currently, this library is in an experimental state and does not have a major release yet.
This might not change for the near future, as there is still a lot of work to be done.
Until then, the versioning will stay at 0.x.x. The first major release will be 1.0.0.
As long as there is no major release, we will only provide support for the most recent (minor) version.

Our library is built using Golang, specifically version 1.21.1, and we aim to stay as close
to the current version of Go as possible to ensure security and compatibility.

As of now, this library only supports Go 1.21.x. This will most likely be the case until version 1.22.0 is released.
In the future we will try to follow the official compatibility policy of Go, which means that we will provide support
for the recent two releases. These versions will be 1.22.x and 1.21.x.

Older versions will not receive security updates or fixes.
